            SilkierStrands was built on a simple belief: every woman deserves honest, expert guidance on the hair products she spends her money on. With thousands of options on the market and marketing claims that often overpromise and underdeliver, finding the right product for your hair type can feel overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p className="font-body leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#2C2C2C" }}>
            We test every product we review — from drugstore staples to salon-grade formulas — and give you our honest assessment based on real-world results. Our reviews cover shampoos and conditioners, deep conditioning masks, hair serums and oils, and styling tools including hair dryers, flat irons, and curling irons.

            Our Review Methodology
          </h2>

          <p className="font-body leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#2C2C2C" }}>
            Every product we review is tested over a minimum of two weeks of consistent use. We evaluate products across multiple criteria including performance, ingredient quality, value for money, scent, texture, and ease of use. Our ratings reflect the aggregate of these factors weighted by their importance to the target user.
          </p>

          <p className="font-body leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#2C2C2C" }}>
            For head-to-head comparisons, we test both products simultaneously on the same hair type to ensure a fair comparison. Our winner recommendations are based on overall performance, value, and suitability for the target hair type — not on price alone.
          </p>
